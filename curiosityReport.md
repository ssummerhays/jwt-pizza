## Cloud Vendors Other Than AWS
I have no experience with any other platforms other than aws, so I was interested to see what other services provided, costs, and the various pros and cons in comparison to aws. 

The two most common alternatives to aws that I found in my research were Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. AWS is still the biggest of the three, with Azure coming in second; however, GCP is growing the fastest, with Azure again coming in second. Countless successful companies use all three of these services, so clearly they are all valuable, but what are the benefits of each?


### Microsoft Azure
Coming from Microsoft, Azure is designed specifically for applications centered about microsoft; however, it is not exclusive to microsoft-centered applications.

As of 2021, Azure had the most geographic regions with 64, but not as many edge locations as AWS. Azure has over 200 services which is just lower than AWS. All three cover the main computing needs just implemented differently, with main service differences coming in the specialized services where Azure is comparable to AWS.

As far as pricing, they are all three competitive; however, for applications already using Microsoft services, Azure is the cheapest.

### Google Cloud Platform
GCP is the smallest of the three; however, it is catching up as the fastest growing. Furthermore, many notable companies such as Twitter and PayPal utilize GCP.

As of 2021, GCP had the least geographic regions and edge locations with a total of 40 cloud regions and 187 edge locations. GCP has slightly less services than Azure, although similarly to all 3, it covers the main computing needs, only lacking in specialized services.

Again the price is pretty similar to AWS and Azure; however, GCP doesn't have as many services as AWS and Azure. On the other hand, GCP works very nicely with other google services and integrates well with open-source projects and third-party services.

### Conclusion

While all three of the main cloud computing platforms are great options for most scenarios. AWS remains at the top of the competition in most cases. Azure and GCP are both growing; however, and that could change in the future. It is important to stay curious and up to date with tech news because it can be a valuable asset in adapting to new trends and new services. Ultimately, I am glad I took time to learn about these services and the different pros and cons in case I end up using them in my professional career, and also just because it's interesting to see how different platforms address different problems.
